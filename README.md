## Goal

    - The goal of this little project is learn how to use Fetch API to lead with HTTP requests.

### A little explanation

    - It is used to lead with HTTP requests, instead of the old XMLHTTPRequest;
    - The Fetch API follows the Promise pattern;
    - Documentation: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API/Using_Fetch;

### Notes

    - The API built with Node.JS was not made by me, it was made by a dev from Alura who taught the course about Fetch API.
